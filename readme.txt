rotation matrix complete

challenge:
	writing a custom (warpAffine) function is difficult
	biggest problem is the variable degree that it has to be able to be rotated, as well as the variable point of origin(which would require translation)
	best method? rotating entire matrix somehow? or finding a point on the image, find a second point with rotation matrix, and then swapping their intensity values?
